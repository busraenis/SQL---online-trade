clothes-ordering system in branches

To create an innovative online clothing store system that not only offers a wide range of products but also provides customers with a personalized shopping experience. The system should allow users to order clothing items starting with a specific ID number that are not available in other stores and facilitate sales consultants in efficiently processing orders. After such orders, the sales consultant should receive a certain commission. 


•	Online Store Module: Customers can see all available products for sale.
•	Customer Membership-Registration Module: Customer addresses are recorded here.
•	Product-Order Module: The product the customer will receive is ordered from here by the sales consultant. Moreover, allow customers to order clothing items identified by specific ID numbers.
•	Complaint and Suggestion Module: Customers use this to indicate issues encountered during the order process or to suggest improvements to the system.
•	Warehouse Module: Products, product information, and product stock status are controlled from here.
•	Cargo Tracking Module: Customers can track their shipment from here.
•	Commission for Sales Consultants: Provide sales consultants with a commission for successful transactions of exclusive items.
